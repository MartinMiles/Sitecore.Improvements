Productivity Improvement: 
	Presentation Exists Gutter - Sitecore tree gutter being shown next to "page" items that have presentation details set. Clicking gutter opens Layout Details dialog

Please follow the blog post to get more information about:

Important:
 	Do not forget to reference Sitecore.Kernel and Sitecore.Client libraries from your Sitecore instance before you build the code.


1. Create an items in core database under /sitecore/content/Applications/Content Editor/Gutters folder derived from 
/sitecore/templates/Sitecore Client/Content editor/Gutter Renderer template. 

2. Set type field for that new item to SitecoreImprovements.Gutters.PresentationExists and save

Hope you find this helpful!
